These files are relating specifically to the CSS for the custom templates Scowl (me) created. Eventually this will be broken into a master file (probably on a webpage) with a simple selection of variables added at the top of each skin's CSS file to handle the different colors and adjustments.

This is also where the conversion of the doHTML to BBCode for the on forum templates will happen for ease of reference and issue tracking.
